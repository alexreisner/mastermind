== Blind/Anonymous FTP Server

Install ProFTPd:

  sudo apt-get install proftpd      # select the 'standalone' option

The following is a configuration file for a blind, anonymous-only FTP server. Users can upload and download but cannot see directory contents and cannot overwrite existing files. Much advice was taken from the excellent ProFTPd Limit clause documentation (http://www.proftpd.org/docs/howto/Limit.html).

  #
  # /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf -- This is a basic ProFTPD configuration file.
  # To really apply changes reload proftpd after modifications.
  # 

  # Includes DSO modules
  Include /etc/proftpd/modules.conf

  # Set off to disable IPv6 support which is annoying on IPv4 only boxes.
  UseIPv6               on

  # Port 21 is the standard FTP port.
  Port                  21

  # In some cases you have to specify passive ports range to by-pass
  # firewall limitations. Ephemeral ports can be used for that, but

  # To prevent DoS attacks, set the maximum number of child processes
  # to 30.  If you need to allow more than 30 concurrent connections
  # at once, simply increase this value.  Note that this ONLY works
  # in standalone mode, in inetd mode you should use an inetd server
  # that allows you to limit maximum number of processes per service
  # (such as xinetd)

  # Choose a SQL backend among MySQL or PostgreSQL.
