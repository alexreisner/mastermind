= grep

Most of the time you want egrep (same as grep -E) which uses extended regular expressions. 

Recursively search a directory tree for matches to a regular expression.

  grep -r '<regex>' <path>

Filter output of a command (eg, 'ps aux') for lines that match a regular expression.

  ps aux | grep '<regex>'
