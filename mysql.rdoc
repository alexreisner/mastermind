= MySQL

== Setup

=== Change Password

For root user (from shell):

  mysqladmin -u root -p password [new_password]

For other user (from mysql> prompt):

  SET PASSWORD FOR '[username]'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('[new_password]');


=== Launch UTF-8 Client

  mysql -u[username] -p --default-character-set=utf8


=== Authentication Problems

On error message: "Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client", downgrade MySQL's passwords to the "old" shorter encryption:

    SET PASSWORD FOR '[username]'@'[hostname]' = OLD_PASSWORD('[password]');


=== Character Set/Collation

Good reference: http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=328641&seqNum=3

  ALTER DATABASE [db_name] DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
  ALTER TABLE [table_name] DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;


=== Important UTF-8 Defaults (in my.cnf)

  [mysql]
  default-character-set = utf8

  [mysqld]
  character-set-server = utf8
  collation-server = utf8_unicode_ci


=== Recovering From Big Mistake

If you do something bad (eg, accidentally delete the 'mysql' table), have to re-install the server, and a plain apt-get remove/install won't work, do this:

  sudo apt-get --purge remove mysql-server-5.0
  sudo apt-get --reinstall install mysql-server-5.0


== Optimization

===

Get the size, on disk, of each table in a database:

  SELECT table_name AS "Tables",
    ROUND(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) "Size in MB"
  FROM information_schema.TABLES
  WHERE table_schema = "<database>"
  ORDER BY (data_length + index_length) DESC;


=== Memory Use

The amount of memory consumed by the MySQL server is approximately (in KB):

  key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size) * max_connections


=== Query Cache

Is query cache enabled?

  SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_query_cache';

Query cache details:

  SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'query%';

Query cache performance:

  SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Qcache%';


=== Table Types

List InnoDB tables (MySQL 5.0+):

  SELECT `TABLE_SCHEMA`,`TABLE_NAME` FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE ENGINE = 'InnoDB';

Change a table's engine to MyISAM:

  ALTER TABLE `table_name` ENGINE=MyISAM;


=== EXPLAIN Results

=== mysqld_safe 100% CPU Problem

<i>from: http://forum.slicehost.com/comments.php?DiscussionID=1000&page=2</i>

If the mysqld_safe process is constantly consuming close to 100% of the CPU, try this:

  sudo sed -i 's/sanity_checks;/#sanity_checks;/' /etc/init.d/mysql
  sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart
