= Nginx

Install:

  sudo apt-get install nginx

Test configuration:

  sudo nginx -t

Test specific configuration file:

  sudo nginx -t -c [path_to_file]

Prevent sending server version in response headers:

  server_tokens off;
  # but this directive was added in 0.5.34 / 0.6.15

Suppress 'nginx' name entirely in response headers:

  # can't be done (see http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/145494)

  sudo nginx

Stop:

  sudo killall nginx
