To extract images from a Word Document:

# Open the document.
# Go to File > Save as option and click it
# Select odf as the new format.
# Navigate to where you saved your new odf document.
# Change your document's extension by renaming it from .odf to .zip
# Extract the new .zip archive
# You will find a Pictures folder that contains the images.
